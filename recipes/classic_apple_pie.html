    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3><em>For the Pie Crust:</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups (300g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (28g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (227g) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>6-8 tbsp ice-cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>For the Apple Filling:</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs (1.35 kg) apples, peeled, cored, and sliced (about 6-8 medium apples; use a mix of Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, or Jonagold)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (16g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (28g) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>For the Egg Wash:</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15ml) milk or water</li>
        <li>Coarse sugar or turbinado sugar, for sprinkling (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <h3><em>For the Pie Crust:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor fitted with the dough blade, combine flour, salt, and granulated sugar. Pulse briefly to mix.</li>
        <li>Add cold cubed butter to the food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 8-10 pulses.</li>
        <li>Gradually add ice-cold water, pulsing after each addition until the dough just comes together. You may need more or less water depending on the humidity; use as little as possible without compromising the dough's ability to form a ball.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two equal pieces and shape each piece into a flat disk about 1-inch thick. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>For the Apple Filling:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine sliced apples, granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Toss gently to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Set aside while you prepare the pie crust.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Assembling the Pie:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) with a rack positioned in the middle.</li>
        <li>Remove one pie crust disk from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes to make rolling easier. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle about 12-13 inches in diameter and approximately 1/8-inch thick. Carefully transfer the rolled dough to a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
        <li>Spoon the apple filling into the prepared pie crust, including any accumulated juices from the apples. Arrange the filling evenly, mounding it slightly in the center.</li>
        <li>Dot the top of the apple filling with the small pieces of butter.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>For the Top Crust:</em></h3>
    <p>Repeat steps 2-3 with the second pie crust disk to create a top crust. Alternatively, you can make a lattice-topped pie:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Roll out the second disk as instructed above.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife or pastry wheel, cut the dough into 1-inch-wide strips.</li>
        <li>Arrange half of the strips diagonally across the filled pie dish, spacing them evenly apart.</li>
        <li>Fold back every other strip halfway to expose the filling. Place a second strip perpendicular to the first set, then fold the folded-back strips over the new strip. Continue weaving alternating strips until the top crust is complete.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assembling the Pie:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If using a solid top crust, make several slits or cut-outs in the center to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
        <li>If desired, create a decorative edge by pinching the bottom and top crust edges together with your fingers or using a fork.</li>
        <li>Chill the assembled pie in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes while you prepare the egg wash.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>For the Egg Wash:</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together beaten egg and milk or water until combined.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Baking:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brush the top crust evenly with the egg wash, making sure to coat all edges as well.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle coarse sugar or turbinado sugar over the top crust for added texture and shine (optional).</li>
        <li>Place the pie dish on a parchment-lined baking sheet to catch any drips during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake at 400°F (200°C) for about 20 minutes, until the crust begins to turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C), cover the pie loosely with aluminum foil or a pie shield, and continue baking for another 40-50 minutes, until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 3 hours before slicing to allow the filling to set.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Serving:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Once cooled, slice the apple pie into wedges and serve with whipped cream or à la mode if desired.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enjoy your classic American apple pie! This recipe creates a wonderful balance of sweet apples, flaky crust, and warm spices for an unforgettable dessert experience.</p>
